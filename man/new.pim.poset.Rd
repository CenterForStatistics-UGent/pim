\arguments{
\item{compare}{A character value, matrix or list indicating how the
poset should be constructed. Defaults to the default value of 
\code{\link{create.poset}}. See Details section for more information.}

\item{nobs}{An integer value determining the number of observations
this poset is created for. If compare is not a character value,
the number of observations}

\item{parent}{An optional environment that serves as the parent for the
\code{pim.poset} environment. By default this is the environment
from which the function is called. Note that for a correct functioning,
the parent environment should be set to the \code{\link{pim.environment}}
this object is part of. This is done automatically by the function
\code{\link{add.poset}}.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to other methods.}

\item{comp.value}{a character value to be used as value for the 
compare slot of the object. Defaults to 'custom' and 
should be left at the default without
a very good reason to change it.}
}
\value{
an \code{\link{pim.poset}} object that can be used to
replace the poset in a pim environment.
}
\description{
This function allows you to create a \code{\link{pim.poset}} environment 
that can be added to a \code{\link{pim.environment}} object. You can
use this function to create a custom poset, but in general it's safer
to use the relevant arguments of the \code{\link{pim}} function. 
That way more safety checks are carried out.
}
\details{
A poset (or pseudo observation set) in the context of 
probabilistic index models is a set of indices that determines
which observations are compared with one another. It is used to
construct the pseudo-observations on which the model is fitted.
You can think of a poset as a "pseudo-observation set".

The most convenient way to use this function, is by specifying
a character value for the argument \code{compare}. The value "unique"
creates a poset in such a way that only unique combinations of two
observations are used in the model. The value "all" creates all
possible L-R combinations between the observations.

If you want to define the poset yourself, you can pass either a matrix 
or a list with 2 elements as value for the argument \code{compare}.
Columns of the matrix or elements of the list should either be named
"L" and "R", or be unnamed. When unnamed, the function takes the first
column/element as the left poset, and the second column/element as
the right poset. If the (col)names are anything else but "L" and "R",
these names are ignored and the first column is seen as "L".
}
\section{Note}{

You can omit the argument \code{compare} if you supply a value for
\code{nobs}. You can also omit the argument \code{nobs} if you
provide a matrix or list as value for \code{compare}. The function
will try to deduct the number of observations from the highest 
index value present in the matrix/list

You can't omit both arguments together though, as the function
needs at least some information on the number of observations
the poset is designed for.
}

\section{Warning}{

Changing the value of \code{comp.value} by hand might result in 
errors or a wrongly fitted model. The argument exists for internal
purposes and possible extensions later on, but should not be used.

\examples{
mypos <- new.pim.poset('unique',n=10) # creates empty environment
ls(mypos)
# Using the created poset functions L and R
# Note this is purely as illustration, this makes no sense
# in the context of a pim analysis.
mypos$L(1:10)
mypos$R(1:10)
